# 'usm' assembly (usm)
usm is an assembly language that targets programming languages.

![Logo](media/logo.svg)

**Please Note** usm is in heavy development and the targets are proof-of-concept and incomplete.

If your programming language targets usm then it can be embedded inside other programming languages.

Imagine a library that can be used from any programming language without linking issues. This is possible with usm.

**Current Targets**

* Go
* Runtime (an interpreter)
* Bytecode (usm bytecode reference)

**Planned Targets**

* Java
* C#
* Python
* Javascript
* C
* Rust
* Ruby

usm is inspired by my previous work on [uct](github.com/qlova/usmct). Many things have been learnt from the development of uct and are being used to inform the complete overhaul that is usm.
